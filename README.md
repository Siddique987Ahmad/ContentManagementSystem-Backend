Building a Content Management System (CMS) involves defining clear requirements to ensure the system meets the needs of its users. Here's a breakdown of the typical requirements for a CMS, categorized into various sections:
1. User Management

The CMS should have the capability to manage different types of users with varying roles and permissions.

    Roles and Permissions
        Admin: Full access to all features (can manage users, content, and settings).
        Editor: Can create, edit, publish, and delete content but cannot manage users.
        Viewer: Can only view content, typically for frontend users (optional, depending on the project).

    User Authentication
        Register new users (with username, email, password).
        Login and logout functionality.
        Password reset functionality (with email verification).
        Role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure that users can only perform actions they're permitted to.

    User Profile Management
        Edit user profile information (name, email, role).
        Change password.

2. Content Management

The core feature of the CMS is to manage content (e.g., articles, pages, blog posts).

    Content Creation
    Add new content such as articles, blog posts, or pages.
        WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for formatting text, adding images, and embedding media.
    Content Categorization
        Create categories and subcategories to organize content.
        Assign categories to content items.
    Content Editing
        Edit existing content.
        Save drafts of content for later editing.
    Content Publishing
        Publish or unpublish content.
        Schedule content to be published at a specific date and time.
    Content Deletion
        Soft delete (move to a "trash" or "archive" section).
        Permanent deletion after a certain period or manual review.
    Version Control
        Track changes made to content, with the ability to revert to previous versions.
    SEO Features
        Add metadata (meta title, meta description, keywords) for each content item.
        Support for custom URLs (slugs).
    Multimedia Management
        Upload and manage images, videos, and other media files.
        Ability to embed external media (e.g., YouTube videos).

3. Content Types
   Define different types of content that can be managed by the system.

    Articles/Blog Posts
        Title, body/content, author, date published, tags, categories, etc.
    Pages
        Static content, such as "About Us", "Contact", or landing pages.
